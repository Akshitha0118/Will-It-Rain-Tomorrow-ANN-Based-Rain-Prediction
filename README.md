# Will-It-Rain-Tomorrow-ANN-Based-Rain-Prediction

## Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using historical weather data.

##  This project helped me understand how deep learning models can capture complex patterns in real-world datasets like weather forecasting.

-  => Data preprocessing & feature scaling
 - => ANN model built using Keras & TensorFlow
 - => Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics
 - => End-to-end machine learning workflow

## Weather prediction is a great example of how data science can support better decision-making in daily life. Excited to keep exploring more real-world ML problems and improving my deep learning skills!
